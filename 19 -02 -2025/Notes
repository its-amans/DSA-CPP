1. Idea of pre processing directives (Include and define), brief about the compilation process, data types Primitive and non Primitive, linear non linear 

2. Integer and char data types their usage and inter portability, ASCII CODE and theirÂ operations


Description:

Ans:
1. --> Preprocessing directives are commands that give instructions to the compiler to preprocess the source code before actual compilation starts. They are used for including files, defining constants, and conditional compilation.

Common preprocessing directives:
- `#include`: Used to include the contents of a file or library.
- `#define`: Used to define macros or constants.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define PI 3.14  // Macro means wherever the PI is written in the program is got replaced with 3.14.

int main() {
    printf("Value of PI: %f\n", PI);
    return 0;
}
```

-->The compilation process is the process of converting the source code into the machine code.
    Steps Involved in Compilation Process:
        1. Preprocessing: The preprocessor handles directives for source code file inclusion and macro definitions.
        2. Compilation: The compiler translates the preprocessed code into assembly code.
        3. Assembly: The assembler converts the assembly code into machine code, generating object files.
        4. Linking: The linker combines object files and libraries into a single executable file.


Ans:
2. --> The integer datatype has min 2 bytes of storage and .The range of integer depends on the system architecture (e.g., 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit). It is used to store whole numbers without any fractional part.
The integer datatype has a minimum of 2 bytes of storage.

i.  For a 16-bit system, the range is from -2^15 to 2^15 - 1 (i.e., -32,768 to 32,767).
ii. For a 32-bit system, the range is from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1 .

--> The char datatype is used to store single characters. It typically requires 1 byte of storage and can represent characters using the ASCII code.



Important Questions:

I. A program can be run without any preprocessing directive and library inclusion. Either it gives the output or not.

II. When two characters are added with + sign then their ASCII value got added up and then the new character comes out as result.

Note: But in case of strings when the two strings got added up then they get concatenated.
